# About Me
I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at School of Civil Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University. I am working under the mentorship of Prof. Eryu Zhu. My research interest includes Fracture Mechanics, Machine Learning, Structural Health Monitoring and Shocks & Struts. Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to Mesoscale Modelling of Concretes for my PhD research. 

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
