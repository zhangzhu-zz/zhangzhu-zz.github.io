# About Me
I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href='https://en.bjtu.edu.cn/'><strong><span id='total_cit'>School of Civil Engineering</span></strong></a>, <a href='https://en.bjtu.edu.cn/'><strong><span id='total_cit'>Beijing Jiaotong University</span></strong></a>. I am working under the mentorship of Prof. Eryu Zhu. My research interest includes Fracture Mechanics, Machine Learning, Structural Health Monitoring and Shocks & Struts. <strong><span id='total_cit'>Currently, I am deeply involved in specific projects related to Mesoscale Modelling of Concretes for my PhD research</span></strong>. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email.
