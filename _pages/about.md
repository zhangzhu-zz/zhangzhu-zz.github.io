# About Me
I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at [School of Civil Engineering](http://civil.bjtu.edu.cn/), [Beijing Jiaotong University](https://bjtu.edu.cn/). My research interests include **Non Destructive Testing**, **Carbon Neutrality Science and Engineering**, **Deep Learning**, and **Structural Health Monitoring**.

<strong><span id='total_cit'>Currently, I am deeply involved in my PhD research on Mesoscale Modelling of Concretes using X-CT</span></strong>. If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:zhangzhu@bjtu.edu.cn).
